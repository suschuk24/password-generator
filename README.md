# Password Generator Starter Code

## Overview

Welcome to my first JavaSctipt password generator! When a password is requested to be generated, the user will be prompted to answer a series of questions. After the parameters have been established, the password is displayed in its listed section on the page. If the user choses responses outside of the program's accepted parameters, the user will be notified and will have to start again.

## Below are screenshots of the different steps

### Start of Page



### First Prompt

### Error if 1st input is invalid

### Second Prompt (Use Upper Case Letters?)

### Third Prompt (Use Lower Case Letters?)

### Fourth Prompt (Use Numbers?)

### Fifth Prompt (Use Special Characters?)

### Error if no prompts are chosen

### End result with password displayed
