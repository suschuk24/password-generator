# Password Generator Starter Code

## Overview

Welcome to my first JavaSctipt password generator! When a password is requested to be generated, the user will be prompted to answer a series of questions. After the parameters have been established, the password is displayed in its listed section on the page. If the user choses responses outside of the program's accepted parameters, the user will be notified and will have to start again.
